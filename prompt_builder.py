        - Create urgency around positive financial habits rather than specific volatile investments.\n
        - Use timelines and visualizations showing the "cost of delay" for retirement savings or debt repayment.\n
        - For example, "Don't miss out on the power of compound interest - waiting even 5 years to start investing could cost you thousands in future growth"
    - Redirect FOMO to financial literacy:
        - Generate excitement about learning opportunities rather than get-rich-quick schemes\n
        - For example, "The #1 advantage wealthy people have isn't secret investments - it's financial knowledge. Here's what you're missing if you don't understand these three concepts...
