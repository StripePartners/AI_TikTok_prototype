{"text": "Mastering the crypto cycle is extremely easy and this is how it works. First Bitcoin pumps, then Ethereum pumps, then all of the altcoins pump, then the midcaps pump, then the market drops and microcaps pump. And then the market goes sideways, this is where it gets boring and people start to leave the market. This is where we pay attention the most. Then you have the meme coins pump, the market bleeds, people start yelling that this is a scam and they get angry and this is when I see miserable couch potatoes in my comments, you know, talking about crypto is a scam. Then we get the final dump and then we restart. People know this and they capitalize on it every single time. I'm going to capitalize on it this time. I'm not letting anything, no midcap, no altcoin, no Bitcoin, no meme coin pass me by."}
