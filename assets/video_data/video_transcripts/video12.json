{"text": "Here's three stocks to buy before they're worth $1 trillion. First stock is Broadcom. There's two reasons why I really like Broadcom. First one is being the recent announcement of them launching Bellarine. This product looks absolutely insane and this is going to help increase their competition in the AI industry. Number two is the launch of their private cloud platform, which will improve AI autonomy. Second stock is Visa. The Federal Reserve said that cash transactions accounted for 16% of all transactions in 2024, so clearly the preference for digital payments is increasing. And Visa is well positioned to capitalize on this, being the leader in the industry. Third stock is Walmart. In their previous earnings report, they reported that total revenues were up 5.5% year-over-year. With advertising being one of their new revenue streams, this grew 28%. And with their e-commerce business really starting to catch fire, being the second largest behind Amazon, I expect this company to join the $1 trillion club soon.
