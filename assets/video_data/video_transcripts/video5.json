{"text": "It's the top three stock that I'd invest in right now. If you look at what's happening in the world, you see AI, and if you listen to people that are experts in that field, you'll realize that every six months, it's 10x-ing. In other words, you're in a situation where AI is becoming better and better. So what companies are going to gain because of AI? So I go with the people that produce the shovels. In other words, when there was a gold rush, lots of people sold their farms, sold their businesses, and off went looking for gold. Actually, you can go look for how you can use AI, or you can actually look at who's producing the shovels. In this case, it's semiconductors, people producing chips, Nvidia, of course, is one, Broadcom is another. For me, I will be investing in the companies producing the shovels. What about you? What's the best things to invest in right now, in your opinion? Leave a comment below."}
