{"text": "This is your last opportunity to get these altcoins at these cheap-ass prices. This market is going to take off on you. It is sitting at the 3A2, just like it was the previous cycle. And I'm not talking about an individual crypto altcoin, I'm talking about all the damn altcoins. That is the whole altcoin market cap, $586 billion. That's all of them. Sitting at the 3A2, this is normal. Anybody not understanding this that don't know how to chart, they are wasting valuable, valuable time in the market. They don't know what they're doing. People like me, we are buying this stuff. We know when this takes off. It's too late to go back. It ain't coming back down to the 3A2. It's been there for freaking months."}
