M y “one subject” is capital allocation, and my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D.  What most hurt us during
the year was the inferior performance of Berkshire’s equity portfolio — and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving
aside  the small piec e of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine. 3

Then, on February 25 the lenders said they were taking a  “second look” at financing terms “ in view of the severely  depressed housing industry and its impact on Arcata’s outlook.”  The stockholders’ meeting was postponed again, to April.

To quote Yogi Berra; “It was deja vu  all over again.”       During most of the time when we normally would have been  purchasers of RJR, our activities in the stock were restricted  because of Salomon’s participation in a bidding group.

need not fear heavy traffic.”  If he had sought truly deserted streets, however, the Senator should have 
looked to Corporate America’s accounting. Despite our country’s many imperfections and unrelenting problems of one sort or another, America’s rule 
of law, market-responsive economic system, and belief in meritocracy are almost  certain to produce ever-
growing prosperity for its citizens. America’s CEOs had

growing  number of otherwise high-grade managers — CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for you r
children or as trustees  under your will — have come to the view that it’s okay to manipulate earnings to satisfy
what they believe are Wall Street’s desires. But whe n operations don’t produce the result hoped for, these CEOs resort
to unadmirable accounting stratagems. Indeed, many CEOs  think this kind of manipulation is not only okay,
but actually their duty .",Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders - 1998_page13,letters,

Street, they will ignore the 140 — which, after all, came from a “discontinued” swing — and will classify our

experimentation: “Once a philosopher, twice a pervert.”
In  the acq uisition arena, restructuring has been raised to an art form: Managements now frequently us e

and swell future e arnings.",Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders - 1998_page13,letters,
745,Who doesn't find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead to increased future earnings?,ceos,"CEOs understandably do not find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead t o
increased future “earnings.”
An  example from the property-casualty insurance industry will illuminate the possibilities. The CEOs of two large
banks,  one of them a man who’d made many acquisitions, were involved not long ago in a friendly merge r
discussion (which in  the end didn’t produce a deal).",Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders - 1998_page14,letters,
746,Who is laying the groundwork for future infusions of earnings?,acquirer,"The veteran acquirer was expounding on the merits of the
possible combination, only to be skep tically interrupted by the other CEO: “But won’t that mean a huge charge,”
he asked, “perhaps as much as $1 billion?”  The “s ophisticate” wasted no words: “We’ll make it bigger than that
— that’s why we’re doing the deal.”
A pr eliminary tally by R. G. Associates, of Baltimore, of special charges taken or announced during 1998
— that is, charges for When deals occur in which liabilities are increased immediately
and substantially, simple log ic says that at least one of those virtues must have been lacking — or, alternatively,
that the acquirer is laying the groundwork for future infusions of “earnings.”

747,What is the SEC trying to get to clean up its act?,america,"In a landmark speech  last September, Levitt called for an end to “earnings
management .”   He correctly observed, “Too many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants i n
a  ga me of nods and winks.”  And then he laid on a real indictment: “Managing may be giving way t o
manipulating; integrity may be losing out to illusion.”
I urge yo u to read the Chairman’s speech (you can find it on the Internet at www.sec.gov) and to support
him  in his efforts to get corporate America to deliver a straight story to its owners. (“Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.”)
A big piece of news, however, is tha t the SEC, led by its chairman, Arthur Levitt, seems determined to get

departme nts  that these corporations typically maintain. Shareholder-Designated Contributions
Ab out  97.5% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 1998 shareholder-designated contribution s

749,Who instructed Berkshire to make contributions of $130 million?,shareholders,"Cumulatively, over the 18 years of t he program, Berkshire has made contributions of $130 million pursuant
to  the instructions of our shareholders. But if it is “earnings guidance” or the like tha t
shareholders or analysts seek, we will simply guide them to our public documents. These practices leave the great bulk

dealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other. Many people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can’t bear

Doing so, we will add a test that we believe is important, but far from determinative, in fostering
independence: We will select directors who have huge an d true ownership interests (that is, stock that they or
their family have purchased, not been given by Berkshire or received via options), expecting those interests to
influence their actions to a degree that dwarfs other considerations such as prestige and board fees. It baffles me how the many directors who look to these dollars for
perhaps 20% or more of their annual income can be considered independent when Ron Olson, for example,
who is on our board, may be deemed not independent because he receives a tiny percentage of his very large
income from Berkshire legal fees. To find new directors, we will look through our sh areholders list for people who directly, or in their

have much of value to say – when it advocates the incredible on issues of significance to itself.”
That loss of credibility has occurred. The disheartening result: Of the 500 companies in the S&P, 498 adopted the method deemed less
desirable, which of course let them report higher “earnings.”  Compensation-hungry CEOs loved this
outcome: Let FASB have the honor; they had the system. The job of CEOs is now to regain America’s trust – and for the

Nor was the party over in 1938 for an investor:  Though  the $40 invested in 1919 in one share had (with dividends  reinvested) turned into $3,277 by the end of 1938, a fresh $40 then  invested in Coca-Cola stock would have grown to $25,000 by yearend  1993.

2544,What is the most accurate look-through earnings?,berkshire,"As we calculate them, look-through earnings  consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous  section, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major  investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our  profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by  Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been  distributed to us. In addition, on pages 53-59, we have  rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments on a non- GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and  I think about the company. ""Look-Through"" Earnings       In past reports, we've discussed look-through earnings, which  we believe more accurately portray the earnings of Berkshire than  does our GAAP result.",Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders - 1994_page11,letters,

Though its results will  be highly volatile, this operation possesses an intrinsic value  that exceeds its book value by a large amount - larger, in fact,  than is the case at any other Berkshire business If you are not comfortable with this level of  exposure, the time to sell your Berkshire stock is now, not after  the inevitable mega-catastrophe.",Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders - 1994_page15,letters,

This problem arises from the decline in bond prices and the  insurance accounting convention that allows companies to carry  bonds at amortized cost, regardless of market value.

2604,What is the source of money to purchase and hold the bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders and claimants - money which is temporarily on deposit with?,insurer,"The consequences of this directive are predictable: (a) with  most business both price sensitive and renewable annually, many  policies presently on the books will be lost to competitors in  rather short order; (b) as premium volume shrinks significantly,  there will be a lagged but corresponding decrease in liabilities  (unearned premiums and claims payable); (c) assets (bonds) must  be sold to match the decrease in liabilities; and (d) the  formerly unrecognized disappearance of net worth will become  partially recognized (depending upon the extent of such sales) in  the insurer’s published financial statements.

nudges.",RichardH Nudge.pdf_page8,books,

save more if they get paid biweekly because twice a year they get three pay
checks in one month. There is, in those
situations, no way of avoiding nudging in some direction, and whether in-
tended or not, these nudges will affect what people choose. But uninten-

neutrality are unattractive; we shall encounter many examples.",RichardH Nudge.pdf_page10,books,

who make no active choice can be given the same choice they made the
previous year, or their choice can be set back to “zero.” Suppose that last
year an employee, Janet, contributed one thousand dollars to her retire-
ment plan. If Janet makes no active choice for the new year, one alternative
would be to default her to a one thousand–dollar contribution; another
would be to default her to zero contribution. Libertarian paternalists would like to set the default by asking what
reﬂective employees in Janet’s position would actually want.",RichardH Nudge.pdf_page12,books,

*It is possible to predict the outcome of congressional elections with frightening ac-
curacy simply by asking people to look quickly at pictures of the candidates and say
which one looks more competent. Brain scientists are able to say that the activities of
the Automatic System are associated with the oldest parts of the brain, the
parts we share with lizards (as well as puppies).2
The Reflective System is more deliberate and self-conscious. (Voters, by the way, seem to rely
primarily on their Automatic System.3 A candidate who makes a bad first
impression, or who tries to win votes by complex arguments and statistical
demonstrations, may well run into trouble.",RichardH Nudge.pdf_page20,books,
3239,What do teenagers use to size up complex situations?,automatic systems,"fancy intuitions; their Automatic Systems allow them to size up complex
situations rapidly and to respond with both amazing accuracy and excep-

and using the Reflective System is much slower.",RichardH Nudge.pdf_page21,books,

golfer to avoid reflection and to rely on her Automatic System—so much

The Automatic System can be trained with lots of repetition—but such
training takes a lot of time and effort. One way to think about all this is that the Automatic System is your gut
reaction and the Reflective System is your conscious thought. Gut feelings
can be quite accurate, but we often make mistakes because we rely too

Socializing Nondrinking

promote “security” and suitable for a modern democracy.1 Most Ameri-

These lawsuits cost a lot of money—estimates range from $11 billion to
$29 billion per year.2 Exposure to medical malpractice liability has been es-
timated to account for 5 to 9 percent of hospital expenditures—which
means that litigation costs are a contributor to the expense of the health
care system.3 Of course these particular ﬁgures are controversial and may

Another problem with the current system is that jury awards for the pain
and suffering that may be associated with a medical malpractice claim are
highly erratic Other studies ﬁnd little evidence that our current system provides sig-
niﬁcant deterrence against medical negligence.5 It is probably true that at
least a few doctors are more careful because of the threat of being sued, but
on balance, there is no reliable evidence that the threat is doing a lot of
good. But in many

knowledge is a dangerous thing,” a sentiment excerpted from his 1709, ‘An
Essay on Criticism’, where he opined:
“A little learning is a dangerous thing; drink deep, or taste not the Pierian
spring: there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely
sobers us again.”
However, Pope’s warning about cursory knowledge is actually predated by a
similar expression penned by an anonymous author, going only by the initials
AB, who wrote in ‘e Mystery of Phanaticism’:
“…a little knowledge is apt to puﬀ up, and make men giddy, but a greater
share of it will set them right, and bring them to low and humble thoughts

limited is that movements in investor sentiment are in part unpredictable, and
therefore arbitrageurs betting against mispricing run the risk, at least in the
short run, that investor sentiment becomes more extreme and prices move even
further away from fundamental value. For example, limited arbitrage in
closed-end funds predicts average underpricing of such funds regardless of the exact form of investor
sentiment that these funds are subject to (see De Long et al., 1990a; Lee et al., 1991). Other models in

same sign as last periodÕs earnings shock.j1 and j2 govern the transition probabilities between
regimes. On the other hand, ifnL and nH are both at the low end, the investor believes
that shocks are relatively likely to be reversed, regardless of the regime: this leads
to underreaction, but overreaction might not hold. Hence the average return following a positive shock is
lower than that following a negative shock, which is a characterization of
overreaction rather than of underreaction.",A model of investor sentiment.pdf_page21,books,
